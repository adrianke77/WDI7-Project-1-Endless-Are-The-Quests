      To start the game, click the "again" button and enter a word or phrase.
      The same word or phrase when replaying will produce the same game map; 
      different ones create a new random map.

      The aim is to defeat the Fallen Knight (who has a Grim Reaper-style appearance)
      somewhere in the south-easternmost part of the map.

      The key to the game is limiting how many monsters attack you at a time, 
      and being on terrain with good defense while your target is on poor terrain.

      The control guide in the upper right of the screen will show the keys for the game.

      The map can be zoomed or panned using your browser zoom and panning.
      The zoom will need to be reset when restarting the game.

      Your character is the Knight. He cannot enter water tiles or attack monsters on water tiles.
      The same applies to walking monsters. Flying monsters cannot enter or attack forest tiles.

      Monsters start the game docile; you can safely move around them. 
      Triggering them makes them hunt; every turn they move towards you or attack you.

      Attack monsters by moving towards them when they are on a neighbouring hex. 
      Attacking triggers monsters in all neighbouring hexes, due to noise.

      You can trigger monsters from two hexes away using the Shout action. 
      Beware, a Shout triggers every monster you can see to chase you.

      A good tactic is luring monsters from situations bad for you to situations good for you 
      (you on good terrain and monsters on bad terrain).

      Don't rush in blindly; health only recovers partially per level. 
      It works best to carefully hunt weaker monsters to gain levels.

      Click once you have finished these instructions.
